I am Christopher Truman and I make mobile apps.  I have spent most of my career focused on iOS and making awesome experiences for the iPhone and iPad.  I live in Los Angeles and currently work at [CityGrid Media](http://citygrid.com) working on [Citysearch](http://citysearch.com), [Urbanspoon](http://urbanspoon.com), and [InsiderPages](http://insiderpages.com).  I want to make the greatest mobile software experiences possible.

I will use this blog as a place to save ideas, talk about hot topics, and journal my career and life.  Feel free to contact me if you have questions about apps or could use my services.
