I went from being an unemployed college dropout to a software engineer in 2 years.

I apologize if that sounds like bragging, but I want to share a bit about my crazy journey from $8/hour to $95k/yr.  I am far from a genius and I am not necessarily a "go-getter" who is ["crushing it"](http://crushitbook.com/ "crush it book") everyday.  I spent high school doing musical theater and spending time with friends, and spent college trying to figure out what I wanted to do in my career.  I found myself barely making it through my second year of college with a ton of debt and no foreseeable career.

I must preface this with the fact that I had always been interested in technology and had some minor experience previous to this.  I loved video games and had spent much of my middle school years trying to write code for my GameBoy Advance and Nintendo DS.  I learned HTML through a community college class and began building websites for friends and family.  I was able to make a bit of side money making websites during high school.  I was always curious about learning more web technologies, but never really spent time researching or learning that much.  I spent a lot of time messing around in Photoshop and Illustrator, but never got proficient.  When I went to college, I got the MacBook Pro with the free iPod Touch deal.  This was the first gen iPod touch and I immediately attempted to jailbreak it.  Long story short, I began writing little bits of code for iOS and when the SDK came out, I dove in.  I had a lot of free time at college and learned a lot about the iOS ecosystem.  Got a few freelance jobs doing projects and had a ton of fun doing them and was able to make a decent wage.
