I have moved on again.  Well, it was back in March, but I haven't blogged since then, so consider this my announcement.  Just as I was getting excited to work on [some new projects][1] with [Citysearch][2], storms started brewing at [Citygrid][3].  I began to passively look for other job opportunities in case things went south with Citygrid.  Due to experiencing  [layoffs][4] and [changes in the executive team][5], I had reason to be wary.  I was offered a position with [Foursquare][6] that was mighty tempting, but I am currently grounded in LA due to family and my now fiancée.  So now I was stuck at a company in a very unsure position with no job prospects.  Luckily, my fiancée's father had recently started with TripAdvisor in November of '12 and had heard about an iOS developer position with [VirtualTourist][7] in the TripAdvisor LA office.  I was offered a position and took it immediately. 

I spent my last few weeks at Citygrid shelving my year's work and pushing forward an effort to make Cityseries a reality.  The [Cityseries iPad app][1] was eventually published in a sad state after I left and their [guides][8] product seems to have mostly flopped.  2 days after I left Citygrid, the whole team I had been working with on [Insiderpages.com][9], including my [fiancée][10], were all laid off.  Sadly, all of our work was canned and the entire company has gone into a defensive state as it slowly fades into anonymity and eeks out small profit.  The company underwent [more layoffs][11] and a [new CEO][12], so I think it was a good time to leave anyway. 

My fiancée took some much deserved rest and is now working away at [our church][13] building a great new site and overall look for the church.  I am working on multiple mobile initiatives with [TripAdvisor][14] and [VirtualTourist][7].  Virtual Tourist wants to create a better mobile web experience while also creating some native mobile apps to help travelers share and organize photo albums.  I am looking forward to hopefully bring some innovation to Virtual Tourist and leverage [TripAdvisor's new meta product/experience][15] to create excellent mobile hotel research experiences.  Like I mention in my article [Startups Aren't The Only Place To Innovate][16] and this is definitely true with the TripAdvisor Media Group.  The resources and customers that TripAdvisor provides are an excellent starting point for any startup to leverage.  TripAdvisor has also been snatching up several companies in exciting spaces such as [Jetsetter][17], [GateGuru][18], and [TinyPost][19], which shows they are very interested in mobile and staying on top.  I hope innovation can thrive throughout the TripAdvisor Media Group, and I can be a small part of it at VirtualTourist.  

If anyone is reading this, I would love to get some feedback on what you think needs to change in the hotel/flights/vacation research process on web and mobile or any general ideas regarding VirtualTourist, TripAdvisor, or travel in general.  Hit me up [@chris__truman][20]
